          As a healthcare security and analytics company, Medigate faced a major
          problem - how to explain to their medical clients exactly what they
          offered. Despite having a unique product and incredible services, they
          struggled to cut through a crowded market and communicate their value
          proposition to potential clients who didn’t fully understand what they
          could do or why their services were needed. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Medigate had to find a way to explain exactly what they did and how their
          services were unique and beneficial in a way that their target audience
          could easily understand.

          Medigate partnered with us to create a team that was focused and
          responsive. We listened to their needs and concerns and made their
          priorities our priorities. <br />
          <br />
          Through open communication and market research, we realized that
          Medigate’s target audience needed to be educated about what exactly
          cyber healthcare security is, how it works, and what Medigate can
          offer that others can’t. To do this, they needed a WordPress website
          that would guide their potential clients through a strategically laid
          out educational and sales program that would explain what they did and
          make the case for implementation in an accessible and easy to
          understand way. <br />
          <br />
          Our team of expert Digital Marketers created a plan that pulled
          together a specially designed website, new branding, and targeted
          marketing. The end result was a sleek website with integrated branding
          that draws clients in, teaches them what they need to know, and makes
          a sale. Through our partnership, Medigate has grown their number of
          new users by 235%, they’ve doubled their return on advertising
          spending, and they’ve won awards and honors from others in the
          industry who are hoping to mimic just a bit of the success that
          Medigate has experienced from our professional expertise.

        Branding was a key ingredient in our overall plan for Medigate. In order
        to cut through the clutter they faced in a crowded market, we knew that
        Medigate had to stand out and be recognized as the specialists they are.
        We wanted potential clients to see Medigate and know they didn’t cut
        corners. Their website would communicate their attention to detail and
        their high level of professionalism. To achieve this, we used unique
        art-directed photography and integrated subtle brand elements throughout
        the website. We didn’t just want to sell new clients on a product, we
        wanted them to believe in who Medigate is as an industry-leading
        company.
