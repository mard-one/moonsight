        The first step was to understand the business goals in order to design a
        comprehensive and user oriented website while building the UX
        fundamentals, such as research and user flows, moving into the creation
        of a design system to be developed in the website, creating consistency
        throughout as well as ensuring the scalability of the components and
        lastly, categorazing and grouping all the information to be included in
        the web as sections or tabs in the menu. <br />
