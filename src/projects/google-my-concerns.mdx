        As a healthcare security and analytics company, Medigate faced a major
        problem - how to explain to their medical clients exactly what they
        offered. Despite having a unique product and incredible services, they
        struggled to cut through a crowded market and communicate their value
        proposition to potential clients who didnâ€™t fully understand what they
        could do or why their services were needed. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Medigate had to find a way to explain exactly what they did and how their
        services were unique and beneficial in a way that their target audience could
        easily understand.
