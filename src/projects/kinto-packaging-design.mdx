        As a healthcare security and analytics company, Medigate faced a major
        problem - how to explain to their medical clients exactly what they
        offered. Despite having a unique product and incredible services, they
        struggled to cut through a crowded market and communicate their value
        proposition to potential clients who didn’t fully understand what they
        could do or why their services were needed. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Medigate had to find a way to explain exactly what they did and how their
        services were unique and beneficial in a way that their target audience could
        easily understand.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph title="approach" noMarginBottom>
        Medigate partnered with us to create a team that was focused and
        responsive. We listened to their needs and concerns and made their
        priorities our priorities. <br />
        <br />
        Through open communication and market research, we realized that
        Medigate’s target audience needed to be educated about what exactly
        cyber healthcare security is, how it works, and what Medigate can offer
        that others can’t. To do this, they needed a WordPress website that
        would guide their potential clients through a strategically laid out
        educational and sales program that would explain what they did and make
        the case for implementation in an accessible and easy to understand way.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Our team of expert Digital Marketers created a plan that pulled together
        a specially designed website, new branding, and targeted marketing. The
        end result was a sleek website with integrated branding that draws
        clients in, teaches them what they need to know, and makes a sale.
        Through our partnership, Medigate has grown their number of new users by
        235%, they’ve doubled their return on advertising spending, and they’ve
        won awards and honors from others in the industry who are hoping to
        mimic just a bit of the success that Medigate has experienced from our
        professional expertise.
