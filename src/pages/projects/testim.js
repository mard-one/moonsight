              Being the testing one of the most challenging and crucial stages
              of the software development, the strategy on the inclusion of a
              pack of fresh and youthful illustrations was to make the
              experience fun and pleasant.
              <br />
              <br />
              The illustrations were inspired by the testing and automation
              processes, and they were used in key screens of the journeys so
              that the user could relate the information that was communicated
              to him on the scenarios like onboarding, success, errors, bugs and
              more.
